ce code r√©soudre les puzzles logique avec les algorithmes "knowledge-based approach"
exemple :

from logic import *

# Symbols for A, B, C
AKnight = Symbol("A is a Knight")
AKnave = Symbol("A is a Knave")

BKnight = Symbol("B is a Knight")
BKnave = Symbol("B is a Knave")

CKnight = Symbol("C is a Knight")
CKnave = Symbol("C is a Knave")

# Puzzle 0
# A says: "I am both a knight and a knave."
# If A were a knight, then that statement would have to be true,

        for symbol_name, symbol in characters:
            if model_check(knowledge, symbol):
                print(f"   {symbol_name}")
